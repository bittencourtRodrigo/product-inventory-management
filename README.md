## Product/inventory management in .Net MAUI

### Easily expandable, loosely coupled, Modular app. The app works with Sqlite. User can create products, edit and delete. Search bar that uses each letter in the search. Typing "p gam" it finds: Pc gamer. It contains a module to download the stock similar to a Pos. It has a catalog for viewing products. And, if you change devices, you can save your data in the cloud and download them later, just make sure you change the connection strings in the app's <a href=https://github.com/bittencourtRodrigo/API-product-inventory-management>API</a>. The app needs a connection to the <a href=https://github.com/bittencourtRodrigo/API-product-inventory-management>API</a>. Not a app for production.
App 100% made by me, from front-end to back-end. Although my focus was on the back-end, I had to build the front-end. I needed an example to share my development methods, besides wanting a lot because of all the learning I cherished. I have so many things to talk about, call me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bittencourtrodrigo/) and let's talk about development.

Topics you will find:
- Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
- Firebase to users management
- Connection with API in .Net MAUI
- Strong segmentation
- Binding on Lists
- Connections Http in .Net MAUI
- Dependency injection configuration in .Net MAUI
- Sqlite in .Net MAUI

## Installation steps (run locally)
- Get Visual Studio community 2022 and install the MAUI .net development tool
- Open the solution that is in the root folder
- Change the connection strings in the data folder
- Now run. You can try it without changing the strings, but you won't have access to the cloud service
